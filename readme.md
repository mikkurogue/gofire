# GoFire


An open source and fun attempt at creating an XFire service but to now not to die and be taken over by some dodgy corp that wants to do nothing but profit off the amazing name that Xfire built for itself and the platform it created.


## What is GoFire?

GoFire is a service (for now) that detects running games (currently only WoW.exe lol - i run linux so its the only one i can reliably test without my machine shitting the bed) and tracks its time in minutes played.

## Plans

The plans are to create a client for the service to run with, an accounts system and a web page for profile viewing etc.

The goal is to make XFire from 2005 essentially, under a new name and new technology!

## Contribution

Contribute by submitting PR's and issues. I am still debating about making a discord server but will only do so if there is some traction and enough people wanting it!
